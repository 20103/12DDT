                            <p>
                                Macleans College, a public school in Auckland, New Zealand, has found a unique solution to their vaping problem: hiring students to replace the school's vape detectors.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The school has been struggling to enforce its strict anti-vaping policy, with students finding creative ways to hide their habit from teachers and staff. But with the recent surge in popularity of free child labour, Macleans College thought they had finally found a solution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The school's vape detectors have proven to be a constant headache. They break down frequently, were triggered by smelly deodorant, and the school's maintenance staff have been unable to keep up with the demand for repairs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That's where the students come in. In an effort to save money, the school has decided to employ students to replace the broken vape detectors. "Who knows our school better than our own students?" said Principal Steven Hargreaves in a recent press conference. "They know where the students like to vape, and they can replace the detectors quickly and efficiently."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The school has already started training a team of students to handle the task. The program will be listed as an extracurricular. They will work during interval and lunch break.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A few students have raised concerns about the school's latest policy. "It's a bit strange that we are expected to monitor ourselves," expressed an anonymous student. "What if the vape detector people are faulty? And what if the students assigned to replace them themselves engage in vaping?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, others have voiced their support for the school's new program. "I personally love the smell of blueberry vape," says Sydney Campbell, a year 12 attending Macleans College, "It would be great to snitch and sniff vape simultaneously."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Despite the concerns, the school is confident that this new approach will be successful. "We're always looking for innovative ways to address our vaping problem," said Principal Hargreaves, "And we're excited to see what our students can do." 
                            <p>
                                Only time will tell if this new policy will be effective, or if it will just create a new set of problems for the school to deal with. But for now, Macleans College is putting its faith in its students to keep the vaping at bay.
